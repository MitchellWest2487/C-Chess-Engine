# Chess Engine in C *(WIP)*
The purpose of this project is for me to learn the C programing language. 
I used the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) as my main resource and have supplemented this 
with a few different youtube tutorials alongside looking at some other open-source chess engines on GitHub like [StockFish](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page).

## Engine Details 
- Uses a bitboard to represent the board
- Uses Magic bitboards to pre-gen moves
